Personal Portfolio Website
üìù Project Description
This project was developed during my 6-week internship at Codetech IT Solutions, under the mentorship of Mr. Neela Santosh, in the domain of Front-End Development. The main goal of this project was to build a responsive Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in a professional format.

üéØ Objective
The purpose of this portfolio was to:

Introduce myself and my interests

Showcase featured projects with links to GitHub

Provide a resume download option

Allow visitors to send messages via a contact form

Implement a responsive dark mode toggle

üß± Technologies Used
HTML ‚Äì for building the structure of the website

CSS ‚Äì for styling the layout and components

JavaScript ‚Äì for adding interactivity (dark mode toggle)

üõ†Ô∏è Development Process
I began the project by structuring the page with semantic HTML5 tags, dividing it into the following sections:

Header with navigation links and dark mode button

Hero Section introducing myself

About Me Section with a short bio

Projects Section displaying project cards with links

Contact Form integrated via Formspree

Footer for copyright

The CSS was used to:

Center the layout using Flexbox and Grid

Apply hover effects and smooth transitions

Set up color themes using CSS variables for light/dark modes

The dark mode feature was added using a simple JavaScript toggle. When the moon icon is clicked, it toggles the dark class on the <body>, and changes the color scheme using CSS variables.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const toggle = document.getElementById("darkToggle");
toggle.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark");
});
üîÅ Version Control
Version control was handled using Git. I committed changes regularly and pushed the project to GitHub, which helped me track progress and maintain a clean codebase throughout development.

‚úÖ Outcome
This project helped me understand:

The importance of clean UI/UX

Responsive design principles

JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation

Real-world GitHub workflows (cloning, pushing, committing)

It boosted my confidence in building web applications from scratch and gave me a professional platform to showcase my work and skills.
