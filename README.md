## 📝 Project Description

This project was developed as part of my 6-week internship at **Codetech IT Solutions**, under the guidance of **Mr. Neela Santosh** in the **Front-End Development** domain.  
The main goal of the project was to design and build a fully responsive **Personal Portfolio Website** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The website serves as a digital resume, showcasing my skills, personal information, featured projects, and a contact form — all in a clean, modern layout.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objectives of the portfolio website were:

- Introduce myself as a frontend developer  
- Display key projects with GitHub links  
- Provide an option to download my resume  
- Include a contact form for easy communication  
- Implement a dark mode feature for better user experience

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For building the page structure  
- **CSS3** – For layout styling, responsiveness, and theming  
- **JavaScript** – For interactivity (dark mode toggle)

## 🛠️ Development Process

### HTML
- Structured the website into semantic sections: Header, Hero, About, Projects, Contact, and Footer  
- Added navigation links and resume download functionality  

### CSS
- Used Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts  
- Styled elements with smooth hover effects, spacing, and shadows  
- Introduced CSS variables (`--bg`, `--text`, `--primary`) to manage theme colors  

### JavaScript
- Implemented a dark mode toggle button (🌙) in the navbar  
- Used `classList.toggle()` to switch between light and dark themes  

```javascript
const toggle = document.getElementById("darkToggle");
toggle.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark");
});
