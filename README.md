## 📝 Project Description

This project was developed as part of my 6-week internship at **Codetech IT Solutions**, under the guidance of **Mr. Neela Santosh** in the **Front-End Development** domain.  
The main goal of the project was to design and build a fully responsive **Personal Portfolio Website** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The website serves as a digital resume, showcasing my skills, personal information, featured projects, and a contact form — all in a clean, modern layout.

- Introduce myself as a frontend developer  
- Display key projects with GitHub links  
- Provide an option to download my resume  
- Include a contact form for easy communication  
- Implement a dark mode feature for better user experience
