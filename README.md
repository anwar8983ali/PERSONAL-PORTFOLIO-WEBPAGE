📝 Project Description
This project was developed as part of my 6-week internship at Codetech IT Solutions under the guidance of Mr. Neela Santosh in the Front-End Development domain. The main goal of the project was to design and build a fully responsive Personal Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website serves as a digital resume, showcasing my skills, personal information, featured projects, and a contact form — all in a clean, modern layout.

🎯 Objective
The primary objectives of the portfolio website were:

Introduce myself as a frontend developer

Display key projects with GitHub links

Provide an option to download my resume

Include a contact form for easy communication

Implement a dark mode feature for better user experience

🧱 Technologies Used
HTML5 – For building the page structure

CSS3 – For layout styling, responsiveness, and theming

JavaScript – For interactivity (dark mode toggle)

🛠️ Development Process
The development process included:

HTML

Structured the website into semantic sections: Header, Hero, About, Projects, Contact, and Footer.

Added navigation links and resume download functionality.

CSS

Used Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.

Styled elements with smooth hover effects, spacing, and shadows.

Introduced CSS variables (--bg, --text, --primary) to manage theme colors.

JavaScript

Implemented a dark mode toggle button (🌙) in the navbar.

Used classList.toggle() to switch between light and dark themes.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const toggle = document.getElementById("darkToggle");
toggle.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark");
});
🔁 Version Control
All changes were managed using Git.
I regularly committed updates and pushed code to GitHub, allowing version tracking and collaboration practices similar to real-world workflows.

✅ Outcome
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Responsive web design

DOM manipulation

CSS theming and layout systems

JavaScript-based interactivity

Using Git and GitHub for source control

It also helped me build a professional online presence and prepared me for future frontend development roles.
